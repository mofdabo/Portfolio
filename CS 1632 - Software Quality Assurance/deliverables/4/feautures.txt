Deliverable 4

Features:
1. Run - this will run one iteration of the Game of Life
	Slow reaction

2. Run Continuous - This will run iterations until you press the Stop button.

3. Stop - This will stop the current "Run Continuous" run. It will have no effect if the program is not running continuously already.

4. Write - This will write the state of the system to a backup file, to be loaded later.

5. Undo - This will undo the previous iteration. It will only work for one iteration (that is, you cannot do multiple undos to get back multiple iterations).

6. Load - This will load a previously-saved backup file (created using the Write button) to the current world.

7. Clear - This will clear the current world.
